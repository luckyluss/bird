# bird
flying bird

When you run this code, it will simulate a bird flying to the left across a blue sky. The bird will move one position to the left each time the simulation updates. The output will look something like this:

                                       >
                                      >
                                     >
                                    >
                                   >
                                  >
                                 >
                                >
                               >
                              >
                             >
                            >
                           >

You can modify this code to change the starting position of the bird, the characters used for the bird and the sky, or the speed of the simulation. You can also add more features to the simulation, such as obstacles for the bird to avoid or other birds flying in the opposite direction.
